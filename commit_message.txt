feat: Implement backend and web admin page setup

This commit introduces the initial setup for the Node.js backend and the React-based web administration page.

Key changes include:
- Backend:
    - Converted Node.js backend to ES Modules.
    - Implemented MongoDB models (Menu, Order, VoiceLog, KioskConfig).
    - Set up API routes (menu, order, voice, config, analytics, auth).
    - Implemented controllers for core functionalities.
    - Added WebSocket for real-time updates.
    - Updated seed script to use provided menu data and ensure proper seeding.
    - Configured environment variables for host, port, and MongoDB URI.
- Web Admin:
    - Created a new React project for the web administration interface.
    - Integrated Dashboard and Menu Management components.
    - Set up basic routing.
    - Configured Tailwind CSS (manual steps required for full setup).
    - Implemented API service for communication with the backend.
    - Addressed initial TypeScript and ESLint errors.
- React Native App:
    - Updated contexts (MenuContext, CartContext, VoiceContext) to use backend APIs.
    - Modified screens (MenuListScreen, MenuDetailScreen) to fetch data from the backend.
    - Removed local menu data.
    - Adjusted environment variable loading.

Current known issues:
- React Native app is not displaying menus, indicating a potential data retrieval or display issue despite successful seeding.
- Web admin page is failing to compile due to persistent Tailwind CSS and TypeScript errors, likely related to caching or build configuration.
