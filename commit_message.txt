feat: Integrate temperature options and image handling for menus

This commit refactors menu management to handle hot/iced options and their respective images more effectively.

Key changes include:
- Backend:
    - Modified `Menu` model to remove unique constraint on name and added imageUrls field for hot/iced images.
    - Updated menuController.js to group menus by name and consolidate temperature options and images.
- Frontend:
    - Updated MenuContext.js to process grouped menu data from the backend.
    - Modified MenuListScreen.js to display a single entry for menus with temperature options.
    - Enhanced MenuDetailScreen.js to allow selection of hot/iced options and dynamically change images based on selection.
    - Adjusted CartScreen.js to ensure independent quantity control for each menu item with distinct options.
    - Fixed quantityButton styling in CartScreen.js to maintain fixed width.
    - Increased image size in CartScreen.js.
- Web Admin:
    - Created constants.js for API endpoints and menu options.
    - Refactored script.js to use API_ENDPOINTS.
    - Updated menus.html to dynamically render menu option checkboxes.
